# MyDerpFaceRecorder

🎯 Project Overview
This project is a video recorder using OpenCV, capturing live webcam footage. Users can view the real-time video stream, start/stop recording, and apply a mirror (decalcomania) effect by clicking the mouse.

## 🎥 How It Works
1️⃣ Run the script to start the webcam feed.
2️⃣ Click the Spacebar to start/stop recording.
3️⃣ Click the mouse to activate/deactivate the mirror effect.
4️⃣ Press ESC to save and exit.

## 🔥 Fun Feature: Decalcomania "Derp Face"
By clicking the mouse, the left half of the video feed is mirrored, creating a symmetrical effect. This can result in hilarious derp faces or surreal art-like visuals, similar to decalcomania painting techniques.
